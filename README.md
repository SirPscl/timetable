### How it's going to look like

An example how a timetable created with this LaTeX package (v.1.41) looks like:

### Overview

This is derived from v1.41 of the LaTeX package for creating one-week timetables as they can frequently be found in universities or schools.
It is, however, incompatible with version 1.41.


### Website

More information can be found online on the project website <http://www.planetk.de/index.php?title=Stundenplan>.


### Usage

For an example on how to use the timetable class, see `timetable.tex`.

The file is currently modified to match exactly my needs.
Display of lecturer is hardcodedly disabled (or however that adverb is).
